## 🧮 Methodology
 
### Target population
Individuals aged **at least 15 years**, residing in Buzău County as of 1 December 2021 — **N = 404,979 people**.
 
### Data collection method
**Face-to-face interview**, conducted by interviewers traveling to the selected localities.
 
### Sample size calculation
 
| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Confidence level | 95% (z = 1.96) |
| Variance (maximum) | 0.25 (p = 0.5) |
| Maximum margin of error | ±3 percentage points |
| Initial sample size (n₀) | 1,064 individuals |
| Design effect (DEFF) | 1.34 |
| Non-response correction | 1.20 (~17% non-response rate) |
| **Final sample size (nₚ)** | **2,013 individuals** |
 
### Stratification
 
The 87 administrative-territorial units were grouped into **5 strata**:
 
| Stratum | Description | No. of units | Selected localities | Interviews allocated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Buzău Municipality (self-selected) | 1 | 1 | 514 |
| 2 | Râmnicu Sărat Municipality (self-selected) | 1 | 1 | 148 |
| 3 | Localities with 4,000–10,000 residents | 23 | 5 | 675 |
| 4 | Localities with 2,000–4,000 residents | 39 | 7 | 548 |
| 5 | Localities with fewer than 2,000 residents | 23 | 5 | 128 |
 
### Two-stage sampling plan
 
**Stage 1 – Locality selection**  
Simple random sampling without replacement in SPSS (*Complex Samples* module), stratified by the `stratum` variable, with a fixed number of units selected per stratum.
 
**Stage 2 – Polling station selection**  
Systematic selection from the Electoral Register (AEP):
- Towns: 2 polling stations per locality
- Communes: 1 polling station per locality
**Household selection**  
Systematic route with a random starting point and a calculated sampling interval per polling station.
 
**Respondent selection**  
**Most recent birthday** method among household members aged ≥ 15 years.
